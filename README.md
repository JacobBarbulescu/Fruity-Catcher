## Gameplay

It's a mad dash to collect as much fruit ![Fruit](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f457c165-9ba6-40af-a396-696f4724b33f) as possible while avoiding the bombs ![Bomb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70e78d39-4f13-49e9-a941-abeb20a3e442) before time runs out!

Grab powerups ![Powerup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cda7c13-46af-41bd-a607-ddcabcc67de2) to gain a myriad of powers including super speed, growth, and even slowing down gravity!

Keep an eye out for the spotted plums ![Spotted Plum](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a717afc-8db6-43a3-8cf1-b7c664bd70a7), as these guys give many more points than their plain counterparts.
